## Professional Resume
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Juan Isidro Gonz√°lez Hidalgo (@jghidalgo14). I have a degree in computer engineering from the University of Granma(2012)
and a master's degree in science from Computation from the Federal University of Pernambuco (2017).
Ph.D. in Computer Science by the Federal University of Pernambuco (2022).
I have experience in the field of Science of Computing, with an emphasis on Theory of Computation and high knowledge of hardware,
software, and maintenance of technological supports in the IT area.

### My experiences as a developer: 
- Development of web applications based on the Unified Process methodology (RUP) for the visual modeling of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), programming with the PHP language with the support of a MySQL database, as a web server the Apache and as an application development tool CodeIgniter framework. 
- In the free open source Joomla web content management system, developed in PHP and with MySQL database. 
- In the area of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence developing applications experimented in data stream environments with concept drifts, implemented in Java code in the MOA data mining framework. 
- Descriptive analysis of statistical models based on the implementation of R and Python programming languages.
